        As you can see from the table above, i have a pretty big family, and that comes with its pros and cons. <br>
        I would say one pro from growing up in a big household is you definitely learn to share at an early age. <br>
        But growing up in a household of 6 is kind of chaotic, especially when everyone is really loud and comfortable<br>
        with expressing their feelings, verbally or physically.

<h2>My Dad</h2>
    <p>My Dad is pretty cool, he works as an aspiring actor and model.<br>
       He loves cars and likes to watch television in his free time. <br>
        He is also great at computers and technical things, he used to <br>
        fix computers as a way of earning income.

    <h2>My Mom</h2>
    <p>
        My mom is 100% japanese and came to america to get married to my dad. <br>
        My mom is a big factor in my life and i don't know what i would do without her. <br>
        She is the main cook in my house and creates food to the best of her ability everyday. <br>
        She also works a job at a japanese clinic and she used to work as a nurse when she lived in japan <br>

    </p>
    <h2>My sister, Kyung Ae</h2>
    <p>
        Kyung Ae is my elder sister and is 2 years older then me.<br>
        She also goes to this school and helped me out a lot with<br>
         teaching me how the school functioned and how i could get involved<br>
    </p>
    <h2>My brother, John</h2>
    <p>
        although his name is John, everyone calls my little brother john<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=whats+does+kun+mean+in+japanese&rlz=1C1SQJL_enUS803US803&oq=whats+does+kun+mean+in+japanese&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4946j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">-kun</a><br>
        oh boy, let me tell you about john-kun, he is like the cliche annoying little brother just x10<br>
        to start off he has a pretty big potty-mouth, and i am always fighting with him <br>
        sometimes even the most pivotal reasons. I could rant on and on about john-kun<br>
        but that would take up the whole page. (this is totally my unbiased opinion)

    </p>
    <h2>My Sister, Annabelle</h2>
    <p>
        My sister is 6 years old and is the youngest one of the family. <br>
        Her name is annabelle but everyone calls her Anna<br>
        She just recently got into youtube and games, so usually half the time<br>
        you will hear a 12 year old screaming, "OMG REMEMBER TO HIT THAT SUB BUTTON!"
