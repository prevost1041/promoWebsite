        Although i love games i also have interests in other things, one big thing is swimming.<br>
        Even though ive never been in an actual swim team, i always loved just to swim and be <br>
        present in the water. Swimming also helps with my asthma a lot so my mom used to always <br>
        take me to the pool and try teaching me how to swim. But when its not summer and i'm stuck <br>
        i always love to cook food with my mom. I also love learning about and working on PC's <br>
        I actually built two PC's along with my dad, Here are some pictures of my 2 pc's<br>

    <img src="img/PC2.jpg" width="360" length="360">
    <p class="b">This is my first pc that i built it is a little slow but gets the job done nonetheless</p>
    <img src="img/MainPC1.jpg" width="360" length="360">
    <img src="img/MainPC2.jpg" width="360" length="360">
    <p class="b">This is the main pc that i built and it is considered the "Main PC" because it works faster and is great for<br>
    playing games and is good for more demanding things.</p>

<h1 class="b">School</h1>
<p class="b">i am currently enrolled in hoffman estates high school. But i originally went to Dooley elementary school <br>
    which is a japanese/english school and basically half the day u learn the regular curriculum and the other half you <br>
    learn japanese.And then after dooley i went to Jane Addams, which i also took japanese as one of my electives.</p>
    <h1 class="b">Classes</h1>
    <p class="b">
        I am currently enrolled in 2 AP Classes and am also taking a language class. One of the AP Classes that i am <br>
        taking is AP World history, which i originally took just because my sister took it and i wanted to do AP <br>
        but as i got more involved in the subject it became pretty fun to learn about history. The other class that i am <br>
        taking is AP Computer science, i always loved computers and anything technical so i knew that i was going <br>
        to take this class and enjoy it, which i do. I am also planning on taking AP Java next year as well. <br>
        I am also taking a french class which also has been fun to take, although it is a little weird learning<br>
        a new language after taking japanese for 9 years.
